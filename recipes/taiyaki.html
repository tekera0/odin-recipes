        <strong>How to Make Taiyaki Batter</strong>
        <p>To make the batter for the Taiyaki, first sift the cake flour, shiratamako, baking powder, 
            and baking soda together using a wire strainer, fine-mesh sieve, or sifter into a medium bowl. 
            This prevents the batter from getting lumpy.</p>
        <p>Next, you want to heat the milk, butter, honey, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl in a microwave oven 
         until the milk is warm enough to melt the butter partially. This took about 50 seconds at 600 watts in my microwave. 
        You can also do this in a pan over medium-low heat. Just be careful not to let the mixture boil.
         Then, you can whisk the mixture together until the butter has fully dissolved.</p>

        <p>Pour the milk mixture into the dry ingredients and whisk the Taiyaki batter together until it has a smooth consistency 
            and is free of lumps.</p>
